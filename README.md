## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Install & Run

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install XAMPP

- Download XAMPP from [Apache Friends](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
- Install it and start **Apache** and **MySQL** from the **XAMPP Control Panel**.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Setup the Project Files

1. Extract the `MiniProject.zip` file.  
2. Copy the extracted project folder (e.g., `MiniProject`) to the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation.  
   - Example path: `C:\xampp\htdocs\MiniProject`

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Database

1. Open your web browser and go to: [http://localhost/phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin)  
2. Click **Databases** tab.  
3. Create a new database. For example, name it: `marriage_db`.  
4. Import the project SQL file:
   - Click your newly created database name.
   - Click **Import** tab.
   - Click **Choose File** and select the `.sql` file included in your project (check inside your extracted folder).
   - Click **Go** to import the database tables.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Database Connection

1. Open the project folder in a code editor (VS Code, Sublime, Notepad++).  
2. Find the file where the database configuration is written ‚Äî usually named `config.php` or `db.php`.  
3. Make sure the database details are correct:

   ```php
   <?php
   $servername = "localhost";
   $username = "root";
   $password = "";
   $dbname = "marriage_db"; // Replace with your database name
   $conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);
   if (!$conn) {
       die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
   }
   ?>
   ```

   - By default, XAMPP uses username **root** with an empty password.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Access the Application

1. Open your browser and go to:  
   ```
   http://localhost/MiniProject/
   ```
   or if you renamed the folder:

   ```

2. Register as a user or log in as an admin (default credentials if provided).
